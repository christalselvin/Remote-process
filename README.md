## Overview

The Role Management API provides endpoints to manage roles, permissions, and role mappings within an application. It facilitates the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of roles, along with associating permissions and tabs to roles. The API ensures secure role-based access control (RBAC) for users.

## Features

Role CRUD Operations: Create, retrieve, update, and delete roles.
Permission CRUD Operations: Manage permissions associated with roles.
Role Mapping: Map roles to specific permissions and tabs.
Role Validation: Validate role-related operations with session keys.
Error Handling: Handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
Security: Secure endpoints with session keys for authorized access.
## Technologies Used
Python
Flask framework
SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management
SQLite database (can be replaced with other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

## Features
Role CRUD Operations: Create, retrieve, update, and delete roles with associated permissions.
